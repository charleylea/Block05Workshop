  <h3>Ollie</h3>
        <img src="Ollie.jpg" width="150" height="100">
      <p>Ollie is a mature brown bear.  He is enjoying his latter years after being rescued from the Black Feather fire in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico in August of 2023.  <!--insert link to NM fires-->He is less social than most of the animals at the zoo.  Especially considering having been displaced from his natural habitat at such a late age.  All in all, he seems to be happy.</p>

  <h3>Mona</h3>
        <img src="Mona.jpg" width="150" height="100">
      <p>Mona is a young female cub born here in early 2024.  She loves to play and makes regular attempts to interact with Ollie.  He pretends to act disinterested, but we think he has come to care about Mona very much.</p>

  <h4>Brown Bear Diet:</h4>
        <p>Ollie and Mona are fed twice daily.  The menu includes salmon, cod, and whitefish.  They are particularly fond of fruits like apples, oranges, and grapefruits.</p>

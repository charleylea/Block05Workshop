  <h3>Ollie</h3>
        <img src="Ollie.jpg" width="450" height="300">
      <p>Ollie is a mature brown bear.  He is enjoying his latter years after being rescued from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Arriba_County,_New_Mexico">Black Feather fire</a> in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico in August of 2023.  He is less social than most of the animals at the zoo.  Especially considering having been displaced from his natural habitat at such a late age.  All in all, he seems to be happy.</p>

  <h3>Mona</h3>
        <img src="Mona.jpg" width="450" height="300">
      <p>Mona is a young female cub born here in early 2024.  She loves to play and makes regular attempts to interact with Ollie.  He pretends to act disinterested, but we think he has come to care about Mona very much.</p>

  <h3>Frankie</h3>
      <img src="frankie.jpg" width="400" height="500">
    <p>Frankie was just returned to us by our good friends at the <a href="www.cmzoo.org/">Cheyenne Mountain Zoo</a> in Colorado Springs, <abbr title="Colorado">CO</abbr>. He was taken there about a year ago in need of veterinary specialists.</p>

  <h3>Coconut</h3>
      <img src="Coconut.jpg" width="400" height="600">
    <p>Coconut is a playful young female.  She is very curious about our visitors and loves to be hand fed peanuts and pets on the snout.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Mella</h3>
      <img src="Mella.jpg" width="400" height="600">
    <p>Mella was a rescue from an exotic pet owner.  She seems very content now in her new surroundings.  Unfortunately, the black market exotic pet business is still operating around the world. <a href="www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/2024/05/03/illegal-pet-trade-5-ways-the-exotic-animal-black-market-hurts-us-all/73525879007/">Click to read more.</a></p>

  <h3>Karl</h3>
      <img src="Karl.jpg" width="500" height="300">
    <p>Karl is a majestic adult male.  He often looks as though he is keeping an eye on what's going on here at his Mini-Zoo.</p>

  <h3>Cookie</h3>
      <img src="Cookie.jpg" width="440" height="520">
    <p>Cookie is a beautiful soul.  As a mature female, she has become less rambunctious.</p>

  <h3>Earl</h3>
      <img src="Earl.jpg" width="416" height="480">
    <p>Earl is the offspring of Cookie!  Born here in captivity.  He is one cool dude!  He likes to look tough, but he is as gentle as they come.</p>

  <h3>Banana Pudding</h3>
      <img src="Banana Pudding.jpg" width="400" height="400">
    <p>Banana Pudding was brought to us as an infant by an animal rescue group.  Having been with us for all of his life, he is very comfortable around his caretakers and is very fun watch!  He has been known to sneak up on Earl and <em>pretend attack</em>, trying to get him to play chase or tag.  Earl puts up with it.

  <h3>Wren</h3>
      <img src="Wren.jpg" width="500" height="340">
        <article>All of the alligators here at the Wild Animal Mini-Zoo are here temporarily before being released back into the wild.  In partnership with our friends at <a href="www.evergladesfoundation.org">Everglades National Park,</a> we take great pride in our ability to rehabilitate these wonderful animals.</article>

    <p>Wren is scheduled to be released back into the Everglads sometime in late 2024.  She was most likely injured by a speeding airboat.  She is doing well now.</p>      
  
  <h3>Aspen</h3>
      <img src="Aspen.jpg" width="500" height="340">
    <p>Aspen is a new arrival to our zoo.  She is not out for our visitors to see.  She is still recovering from an infection.  She is expected to make a full recovery and to be returned to the Everglades soon.</p>

  <h3>Mika</h3>
      <img src="Mika.jpg" width="500" height="340">
    <p>Mika is a quiet, sedentary creature.  She has been with us for five years.  Her injuries would not make it possible for her to be rehomed back into the wild.</p>
